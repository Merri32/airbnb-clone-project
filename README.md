# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build an Airbnb clone web application where users can list, browse, and book stays.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Python (Backend)
- Flask or Django Framework
- Git & GitHub for version control
 

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

- **Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

- **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: Handles asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: A containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing and deployment of code changes for efficient development.


## Database Design

### Key Entities

1. **Users**
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
   - Description: Represents users of the system — both hosts and guests.

2. **Properties**
   - Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `host_id`
   - Description: Contains details about listed properties. Each property belongs to one host (user).

3. **Bookings**
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`
   - Description: Stores booking information. Each booking is linked to one user and one property.

4. **Reviews**
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
   - Description: Users can leave reviews for properties they have stayed in.

5. **Payments**
   - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`
   - Description: Tracks payment transactions for bookings.

### Entity Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews**.
- Each **Booking** has one **Payment**.


## Feature Breakdown

### 1. API Documentation
- **OpenAPI Standard**: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.  
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.  
- **GraphQL**: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

### 2. User Authentication
- **Endpoints**: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`  
- **Features**: Enables user registration, authentication, and profile management for both hosts and guests.

### 3. Property Management
- **Endpoints**: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`  
- **Features**: Allows hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System
- **Endpoints**: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`  
- **Features**: Handles booking creation, updates, and management — including check-in and check-out details.

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Endpoints**: `/payments/`  
- **Features**: Processes payment transactions related to bookings securely and efficiently.

### 6. Review System
- **Endpoints**: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`  
- **Features**: Allows users to post and manage reviews for properties they’ve stayed at.

### 7. Database Optimizations
- **Indexing**: Implements indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.  
- **Caching**: Uses caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.


## API Security

- **Authentication**: Ensures that only registered users can access the system. This protects sensitive user information and prevents unauthorized access.

- **Authorization**: Controls what actions each user can perform based on their role (e.g., guest vs. host). This prevents users from accessing or modifying data they shouldn’t.

- **Rate Limiting**: Restricts the number of requests a user can make in a given time. This protects the APIs from abuse, spam, or denial-of-service attacks.

- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive information like passwords and payment details will be encrypted to protect user privacy.

- **Secure Payment Processing**: Integrates with trusted payment gateways to ensure payment data is handled safely and securely.

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes.  
They help ensure that every code update is automatically tested and deployed, reducing manual work and minimizing the risk of errors.

### Why CI/CD is Important
- Ensures **code quality** by running automated tests before deployment.  
- Enables **faster delivery** of new features and bug fixes.  
- Provides **consistent environments** for development, testing, and production.  
- Reduces human errors by automating repetitive tasks.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows directly from the repository.  
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application to ensure consistent behavior across environments.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrates testing, building, and deployment into a single automated process.
